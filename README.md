# My Works
## Description
Hello, my name is Koshlakov Artem, I am 4'th grade student of MIPT (Moscow Institute of physics and technology) DASR department (Department of Aero - Space Researches)\
On this repository you can see my current and finished works in Python coding, 3D-Modeling and simulating in SolidWorks, Robotics simulations in Gazebo Ignition and coding nodes with ros2, and more projects.

## Finished
* VK and Telegram bot to help manage MIPT football live translations\
This bots were able to change score on translations and telegram or VK chats via pressing 1-2 buttons.
* Rocket Model 2022\
Winner model of 2022 MIPT space festival modeled in SolidWorks.
* Control Theory\
My Control theory tasks on themes: Maximum pontryagin principles, Dynamic programming task, MountainCar using Deep Q-Learning.
* Scripts\
Some scripts that I wrote to help myself in study: mnk - method of minimum squares to draw graphics in my labs.
## Currently working
* Bachelor diploma\
An algorithm for processing data from binocular video sensors to maintain the position and orientation of an unmanned aircraft in space in the event of a failure of the global navigation satellite system.
* Rocket Model 2023\
Rocket model for future space festival, same model with some differences: more aerodynamical stability, altitude and GPS sensors on Raspberry PI platform, fully parametrical computed parameters in Solidworks Flow simulation to reach the minimal friction and optimal center of pressure and center of mass position computation with python.
