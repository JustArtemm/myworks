This is folder with study project of Delivery Rover in simulation
Full report about this work will be added as soon as it will be finished

Short review:

This project includes 3D modeling a robot, simulating its movement with GAZEBO IGN and writing control with ROS2.
Especially my project is a Delivery rover that main goal is to ride from point A to point B avoiding collisions
with anything that probably can appear on its trajectory for example: unexpected walls or people walking in the streets,
one of the tasks that rover have to deal with is to overcome road border when it needs
